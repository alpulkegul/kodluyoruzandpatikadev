# Project Name: Patika & Kodluyoruz

#### Who am I?

Hello. I am Alp. I am studying Information Security Technology at Ondokuz Mayis University. 

#### What's the purpose of repo ?
Apart from the department I study, many branches of software and computers arouse my curiosity. For this reason, I started the [patika.dev](patika.dev) ðŸš€ adventure. In my student life, I like to spend my free time learning. I created this repo to motivate myself and support those who are walking this path.

#### Others notes
* In order to avoid confusion between repos, I have collected all my work in [patika.dev](patika.dev) ðŸš€ course under this repo.
* I don't speak English very well, and I'm trying to improve myself in that direction, so I'm trying to bring it into every aspect of my life. Forgive me if I make mistakes.
* This repo will be continuously updated.
* It is a repo open to every development. For major changes I would appreciate if you contact me first. Feel free to tell me if I'm wrong. Thank you very much.
