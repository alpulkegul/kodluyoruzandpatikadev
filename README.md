# Project Name: Library

#### Who am I?

Hello. I am Alp. I am studying Information Security Technology at Ondokuz Mayis University. 

#### What's the purpose of repo ?
Apart from the department I study, many branches of software and computer arouse my curiosity. For this reason, I started a new adventure with courses such as [patika.dev](patika.dev) ðŸš€ or [https://www.btkakademi.gov.tr/](BTK Academy) etc. I like to spend my free time learning in my student life. I created this repo to motivate myself and support those who walk this path.

#### Others notes
* In order to avoid confusion between repos, I have collected all my work in [patika.dev](patika.dev) ðŸš€ or [https://www.btkakademi.gov.tr/](BTK Academy) etc. course under this repo.
* I don't speak English very well, and I'm trying to improve myself in that direction, so I'm trying to bring it into every aspect of my life. Forgive me if I make mistakes.
* This repo will be continuously updated.
* It is a repo open to every development. For major changes I would appreciate if you contact me first. Feel free to tell me if I'm wrong. Thank you very much.
